$BAIL is a utility token used in the Patrol Prison system built by solpatrol.io to create a unique De-FI locking mechanism for NFTs on the Solana blockchain. The NFTs locked up in the Patrol Prison are targeted by the Patrol DAO and $BAIL is paid out to the Sol Patrol guardians to keep the NFTs in captivity. The fate of these captured NFTs shall be decided by the Patrol DAO court system. 

Highly classified intelligence reports are distributed to Sol Patrol holders within the Patrol DAO. These reports consist of verified on-chain analytics of NFT projects in the Solana ecosystem to allow for investors to make stronger risk based decisions when buying NFTs and minting new projects. The reports are used in tangent to allow the Patrol DAO to have a wholistic view when targeting new projects for the Patrol Prison.

$BAIL is a liquid utility token that is earned in each individual Prison, these token can then be used to post-$bail in the Main Jail to free NFTs that are locked away by the Patrol DAO. The Main Jail posting-$bail rate is pegged to both the price of the $bail and the average price of NFTs in the Main Jail. All $bail spent in the Main Jail is then used to burn bail. Additionally, 100% of royalties generated by the Sol Patrol collection is used to burn $bail.
